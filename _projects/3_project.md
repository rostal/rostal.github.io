The PREDICT and PREDICT-2 programs (2009-2019) were global programs aimed at strengthening global capacity for detection of viruses with pandemic potential that could move between animals and people.

The programs were focused on developing diagnostic capacity within in-country laboratories, improving or developing emerging virus field surveillence systems and the capacity to conduct behavioral risk research, while identifying drivers of emergence, social and potential control points within economic systems and human behaviors to reduce the risk of emergence.

- We used a novel One Health approach to sample people, livestock, wildlife, and vectors simultaneously.
- We collected and identified more than 2,000 ticks and CCHFV was not confirmed in any of the ticks collected to date.
- We completed a One Health serosurvey in northern Tanzania (from Arusha to Serengeti) in people cattle and small mammals. Like studies that have come before us, we found that people and animals in Tanzania have been exposed to CCHFV. 
- We supported 1-4 years of work for 4 graduate students. Our students are in their final year (see below) and are continuing to work on several of the analyses and critical outputs of this project. 

We appreciate all of the contributions of our partners and stakeholders.
