This represents a 10-year collaboration of DTRA-funded research on Rift Valley fever virus in South Africa. The Understanding Rift Valley Fever in the Republic of South Africa (2014-2019) and the Reducing the Threat of Rift Valley Fever through Ecology, Epidemiology and Socio-Economics (2019-2024) projects used a One Health approach to take a whole-of-system look at understanding Rift Valley fever outbreaks, circulation and impacts. 

During this time we have made a substantial contribution to the current understanding of RVFV ecology and epidemiology and more analyses are still underway.
- We collected more than 700,000 mosquitoes and among those identified, we found that the majority were species that could support RVFV transmission. We described the community of mosquitoes on 22 different pans to determine how mosquitoes species interact and replace each other as the environment shifted from drought (2015-16) to flooding (2021-22) (Gregory et al, In Prep).
- We showed that the order in which mosquitoes hatch in the Free State's temporary wetlands (dambos or pans) after the rains was exactly as it was described in Kenya, where the floodwater _Aedes_ are present several days prior to the increase in other mosquito species’ populations (Guarido et al, In Prep).
- We examined the impacts of vegetation and soil types on the presence and abundance of floodwater _Aedes_ mosquitoes (Gregory et al, In Prep).
- We provided evidence that RVFV is still circulating in the Free State, but at such extremely low levels that it is difficult to detect in both mosquito and sheep populations. 
- We developed a mathematical model that suggests the answer is because enough animals were vaccinated by farmers in 2021-23 and this prevented an outbreak. Further, our simulations suggest that the low level of vaccination we documented in the Free State may not prevent the low level circulation we provided evidence for in the Free state.
- We confirmed that RVFV is circulating in far northeastern KwaZulu-Natal, despite there not being any outbreaks previously reported there. 
- A low proportion of people have been exposed to RVFV there, suggesting that the virus does circulate but leaving questions about how its level of circulation varies from that in the Free State.
[comment]: <> (We calculated a more accurate cost estimate of RVF from 2002-2011 - including more information from the livestock producers groups and from those sectors outside of agriculture - and the with conservative estimates were close to $120 million.)
- We demonstrated that the RVF Smithburn vaccine induces the presence of antibodies that persist at least 6 years in sheep.

While we answered many questions, there are still more questions to answer - after all, we’ve only been studying RVFV this intensively for a portion (0.33) of the ~30 years South Africa experiences between large, widespread outbreaks. Our research here will be ongoing.

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
