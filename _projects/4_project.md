As One Health approaches become implemented more broadly, data analysis frequently is analyzed according to traditional siloed disciplines, which we believe negates the power gained by using a One Health approach to data collection. For instance, One Health research conducted traditional study designs from epidemiology or ecology may fail to support systems that require consideration of multiple species. 

Epidemiology’s solutions assume that individuals or clusters are selected with a probability to population size. If population size and density are not correlated or is unknown, then selecting one population will reduce or even negate the representativeness of the survey in another species.

Ecological study designs often result in less representative data at the population level because the population size and density of many wild species is not known. This work seeks to integrate epidemiological and ecological study designs to improve representativeness of One Health studies of zoonotic diseases.

Further, data collection systems, quality assurance processes and data integration vary across fields making it challenging to integrate One Health data within and between projects. 

In this work we focus on designing systems for One Health research, from data design to data management to data analysis using joint inference.

- We collected more than 700,000 mosquitoes and among those identified, we found that the majority were species that could support RVFV transmission. We described the community of mosquitoes on 22 different pans to determine how mosquitoes species interact and replace each other as the environment shifted from drought (2015-16) to flooding (2021-22) (Gregory et al, In Prep).
- We showed that the order in which mosquitoes hatch in the Free State's temporary wetlands (dambos or pans) after the rains was exactly as it was described in Kenya, where the floodwater _Aedes_ are present several days prior to the increase in other mosquito species’ populations (Guarido et al, In Prep).
- We examined the impacts of vegetation and soil types on the presence and abundance of floodwater _Aedes_ mosquitoes (Gregory et al, In Prep).
- We provided evidence that RVFV is still circulating in the Free State, but at such extremely low levels that it is difficult to detect in both mosquito and sheep populations. 
- We developed a mathematical model that suggests the answer is because enough animals were vaccinated by farmers in 2021-23 and this prevented an outbreak. Further, our simulations suggest that the low level of vaccination we documented in the Free State may not prevent the low level circulation we provided evidence for in the Free state.
- We confirmed that RVFV is circulating in far northeastern KwaZulu-Natal, despite there not being any outbreaks previously reported there. 
- A low proportion of people have been exposed to RVFV there, suggesting that the virus does circulate but leaving questions about how its level of circulation varies from that in the Free State.
[comment]: <> (We calculated a more accurate cost estimate of RVF from 2002-2011 - including more information from the livestock producers groups and from those sectors outside of agriculture - and the with conservative estimates were close to $120 million.)
- We demonstrated that the RVF Smithburn vaccine induces the presence of antibodies that persist at least 6 years in sheep.

While we answered many questions, there are still more questions to answer - after all, we’ve only been studying RVFV this intensively for a portion (0.33) of the ~30 years South Africa experiences between large, widespread outbreaks. Our research here will be ongoing.

We appreciate all of the contributions of our partners and stakeholders.

This work was a collaboration that was led by EcoHealth Alliance, the National Institute for Communicable Diseases and the University of Pretoria. Several South African and U.S.-based institutions were collaborating partners for various periods of time during the 10-year project.
