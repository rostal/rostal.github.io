      The need for One Health solutions to global health challenges has never been greater. One Health Research Consulting was launched in 2024 to improve health using approaches work at the interface of animals, people and the environment. In the face of human caused environmental changes, climate change, land use change and increasing pressure for globalization we use scientific methods to identify risk factors and critical control points through field and theoretical epidemiology and ecology. One Health Research Consulting was founded by <a href="https://rostal.github.io/aboutme/">Dr. Melinda Rostal</a>, who has been developing One Health research programs for 15 years. Additionally, our network of partners, collaborators and scientist can be mobilized as needed to support your One Health goals. We will work with you to identify the best One Health solution for your problem.

      One Health is an integrated, unifying approach that aims to sustainably balance and optimize the health 
      <br/>of people, animals and ecosystems. It recognizes the health of humans, domestic and wild animals, plants, 
      <br/>and the wider environment (including ecosystems) are closely linked and interdependent.The approach 
      <br/>mobilizes multiple sectors, disciplines and communities at varying levels of society to work together to foster 
      <br/>well-being and tackle threats to health and ecosystems, while addressing the collective need for healthy food, 
      <br/>water, energy, and air, taking action on climate change, and contributing to sustainable development.
