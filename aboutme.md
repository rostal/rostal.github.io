I am veterinary epidemiologist dedicated to developing One Health solutions to complicated vector-borne and zoonotic disease systems. My work includes establishing wildlife surveillance systems, using epidemiological and ecological methods to reduce and prevent pathogen spill over, developing biosurveillance programs of pathogens in livestock and human populations, training partners in collecting biological samples from wildlife and livestock, using theoretical modeling to examine the mechanisms underlying viral transmission in host populations, and integrating messy One Health data to support integrated analyses. 

I have developed and led research programs on vector-borne diseases in Africa, which involved identifying partners and their organizations, collaboratively developing the proposal for funding, obtaining funding and leading the team in the implementation and analysis of the work. I have led teams and worked with data from multiple disciplines across the One Health Spectrum, this includes veterinarians, epidemiologists, public health officers, environmental scientists (vegetation, soil and climate), sociobehavioral and socioeconomic researchers. 

I have significant analytical and data management experience. I am experienced in risk analysis, standard epidemiological analyses, Bayesian statistical methods, multinomial regression, mixture models. I managed the data from multiple programs that had over 30 individual datasets and developed novel systems to collate, clean and integrate data from disparate disciplines and with my team, wrote the code to implement these data workstreams.

I work to ensure we have a network of stakeholders outside of the projects to ensure the goals of the project are both scientifically relevant and can be used by those most impacted by the diseases. To widen our communication outreach, we have used both community meetings and publications of research summaries in local periodicals for animal owners and have developed informational material working with communities and local artists to spread our message to those who are less literate.

As the consultant working at One Health Research Consulting, I also collaborate with many researchers that can either be brought on as consultants through One Health Research Consulting or subcontracted to through their own organization.

Outside of my research, I enjoy hiking, outdoor photography and spending time with my family.
