I am veterinary epidemiologist dedicated to developing One Health solutions to complicated vector-borne and zoonotic disease systems. My work includes establishing wildlife surveillance systems, developing biosurveillance of pathogens in livestock and human populations, training partners in collecting biological samples from wildlife and livestock, using theoretical modeling to examine the mechanisms underlying viral transmission in host populations, and integrating messy One Health data to support integrated analyses. Outside of my research, I enjoy hiking, outdoor photography and spending time with my family.
